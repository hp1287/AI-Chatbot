# ChatBot with Natural Language Processing (Supervised Learning)

This repository contains the codebase for a ChatBot developed using supervised learning techniques. The ChatBot engages in natural language conversations and provides responses based on predefined intents. It leverages Keras and NLTK for natural language processing.

## Key Features

- **Intent-Based Responses:** The ChatBot is trained using supervised learning to understand user intents and provide appropriate responses based on predefined patterns and intents in the `intents.json` file.

- **Lemmatization:** It utilizes lemmatization to create a consistent and normalized representation of words, enhancing its ability to understand user input.

- **Python Fanbot:** The ChatBot is programmed to express enthusiasm for Python programming and Balaji Srinivasan's content.

- **Jokes:** Ask the ChatBot to tell you a joke for a bit of humor!

## Contributions

Contributions to this codebase are welcome! Whether you want to improve the ChatBot's responses, add new intents, enhance the user interface, or fix bugs, your contributions are highly appreciated.

To contribute, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and submit a pull request.
